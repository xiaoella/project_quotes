# project_quotes

## Overview
Analysing project hours of quoted amount and actual amount (including overtime), based on historic project data of an architectural firm.

As recorded, there has been a noticable amount of overtime worked on some of the projects in the firm, so I am hoping to provide some insights in order to help with the quoting process for future projects.

Please note that for data protection, the site address and director entries have been modified and anonymised in the notebooks.
